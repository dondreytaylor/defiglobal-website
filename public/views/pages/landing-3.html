                    <p>Sachit is a 2016 Finance graduate from Pennsylvania State University. He is highly-skilled professional in the digital asset/blockchain space, with vast experience via several start-ups. Sachit has been involved in the cryptocurrency space full-time now for over 3 years with previous experience as a Financial Analyst. His passion for blockchains and decentralized networks began through a background of mining and handling a large-scale mining operation. In October of 2017, he attended DevCon3 in Cancun, Mexico, and began to truly believe in the future of Ethereum. Sachit is currently the Operations Lead of Bithereum, a fork of BTC, as well as a core team member and Operations Lead at nimbleNODE.io. His goal is to further the advancement of crypto and abstract it in any way possible to deliver easy-to-use solutions for the everyday consumer.</p>
                    <p>This has led him down the path of decentralized finance in Ethereum, and ultimately DeFi Global- where his deep knowledge and passion of both blockchain and finance could be leveraged to empower others and walk them through the slippery-slope of dealing with digital assets. Sachit has assisted in the management of several high net-worth portfolios till date, and always extends a hand to anyone looking for further insight and assistance in the space.</p>
