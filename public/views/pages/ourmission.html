        <p>Our mission at DeFi Global is to provide our clients with a comfortable understanding of the new decentralized financial system, to provide clarity and in-depth analysis of all benefits and risks, and to ensure security and privacy while investing in the asset class of tomorrow.</p>
        <p>There are many moving parts in a complex global economy. In times of overall confidence, there is prosperity- and people benefit. However, overall confidence can be low, due to signs of economic weakness, political uncertainty, or corruption and oppression. Suddenly, markets crash, recessions occur, and the people suffer tremendously. This has happened many times and it is continuing to occur in various parts of the world. In turn, there is no shortage of economists who believe another global economic crisis is upon us.</p>
        <p>In times like these, people seek out safer alternatives to preserve the wealth they’ve spent valuable time and resources to earn. Traditionally, some alternatives include bonds, gold, real estate, and cash. By no coincidence, the 2008 recession birthed a new asset class that is digital, immutable, borderless, and censorship resistant in nature: cryptocurrencies. As an asset class, digital currencies utilize new technology, have no single point of failure, have no bounds, and can be used by anyone in the world. More than ten years later, digital currencies have amassed over 300 billion USD in market capitalization. In addition, they have acquired some of the brightest minds on the planet in the fields of technology, finance, economics, and business.</p>
        <p>Of course, as is the case even with more traditional asset classes, there is a level of risk involved with digital currencies. The market can be very volatile and much of what is publicized concerns scams, even though such things occur outside of this space regularly. But with the proper guidance and understanding, these risks can be highly mitigated.</p>
        <p>Much of the public is beginning to see the value of digital currencies as more than just speculation- they are now seeing it as a safer alternative than their respective fiat currencies, which are controlled and manipulated by central banks. It is no wonder why citizens of countries facing economic collapse are paying premiums for these assets. These views are only growing stronger in the face of a potential recession.</p>
        <p>At this stage, the barrier to entry is high and the learning curve is steep. This leaves many people who want to partake in this new, decentralized financial system on the outside looking in. With plenty of unfamiliar terms, such as: DEX’s, tokenization, smart contracts, proof of stake, private keys, stablecoins, and more, it is understandable why those looking to enter are hesitant.</p>
        <p>Our aim is to break down the complexities of digital assets into their simplest form. DeFi Global is here to fully understand your financial needs and deliver services and solutions that help build, preserve, and manage your wealth through decentralized finance.</p>
